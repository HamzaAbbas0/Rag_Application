Golf course employees perform a variety of job activities that could cause injury and property damage.  \\nShop Safety:  \\nA variety of tasks are performed in these shops that create potential injury and property damage exposures. Some \\nof the more common safety hazards and precautions are described below.  \\nMaterial Handling:  \\nGolf course employees may be required to handle a variety of different materials such as boxes, tools and \\nequipment. They may be exposed to back injuries and other musculoskeletal injuries from improper lifting techniques. Material handling equipment, such  as carts, hoists, and cranes should be provided to limit manual \\nmaterial handling. Employees should also be trained in proper lifting techniques in order to prevent back and \\nsimilar injuries.  \\nBattery  Charging:  \\nBattery chargers are usually found in shops f or charging batteries in golf carts and other equipment. Hazards \\ninclude fires from the buildup of hydrogen, acid burns from contact with battery fluid, and electrical shock. Battery \\ncharging areas need to be adequately ventilated and ignition sources remo ved from the area. Eye protection, \\nrubber aprons and rubber gloves need to be worn when handling batteries. Eyewash fountains and safety showers should also be provided in the event of contact with battery acid.  \\nHazardous  Chemicals:  \\nFlammable liquids and gases, corrosives, oxidizers, and toxic chemicals may be used in golf course shops and other \\nareas. The following must be followed and/or available:  \\n• An inventory of chemicals used or stored at the golf course . \\n• Collecting and making available to  employees Material Safety Data Sheets for all  chemicals.  \\n• Labeling chemical containers.  \\n• Training employees on the hazards and safeguards for applicable  chemicals.  \\nIn addition, proper disposal practices  must be followed to prevent environmental contaminatio n. \\nElectrical  Safety:  \\nElectrocution and shock hazards are possible when working with electrical tools and equipment. Equipment and tools need to be inspected to ensure that electrical cords and other components are in good condition. Extension cords need to be kept free of frays and should not be used to power fixed electrical  equipment.  \\nTools and  Machines:  \\nHand and portable powered tools such as grinders, drills, saws, sanders, etc. are used in most shops. Lawn mower \\nblade sharpeners, grinders, drill presses, table saws, etc. may also be used. Such equipment poses a risk of \\nelectrical shock, cuts, amputations, eye injuries, and other injuries. Basic safety measures that should be followed \\nwhen using tools and machines include:  \\n• Tools and machines shoul d be inspected prior to use to make sure they are in safe  condition.  \\n• Machine guards should always be used when operating the tool or  machine.  \\n• Employees should be trained on each piece of equipment or tool they may be required to  operate.  \\n• Personal protectiv e equipment should be used to protect employees from inherent  hazards.  \\n  ', metadata={'source': 'Bussiness_facility/Golf-and-Grounds-Maintenance-Safety-Manual.pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=' \\nFlammable Liquids and  Gases:  \\nGasoline, flammable paints and solvents, oxygen/acetylene, propane and other flammable materials are \\ncommonly used at golf courses. In addition to the pot ential fire and explosion hazards, some solvents may be toxic \\nand harm the environment. Basic safety precautions to use when handling these materials include:  \\n• Eliminate any ignition sources, such as cigarettes and other open flames that cause  fires.  \\n• Ensure  there is adequate ventilation.  \\n• Use approved flammable liquid containers for gasoline and other flammable  liquids.  \\n• Obtain Material Safety Data Sheets.  \\n• Label all containers as to  contents.  \\n• Store flammable liquids in approved flammable liquid safety cabinets.  \\n• Dispose of oily rags in approved  containers.  \\n• When dispensing flammable liquids, bond and ground containers to prevent fires from static electricity.  \\n• Wear prescribed personal protective  equipment.  \\n• Dispose of waste materials according to environmen tal laws.  \\nHousekeeping:  \\nDisorderly an d dirty shops breed accidents. Good housekeeping conditions need to be maintained. \\nWalking/working surfaces should be kept clear of slip/trip/fall hazards. Trash should be emptied at least daily. Storage areas should not be overloaded and tools should be s tored in an orderly and safe manner.  \\nPersonal Protective  Equipment:  \\nGolf course employees need to use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) to protect them from various job hazards. Items such as hardhats, safety glasses or goggles, hearing prote ction, respirators, gloves, safety shoes, \\nand other protective equipment that are supplied for use by employees.  \\nLANDSCAPING SAFETY:  \\nA variety of potential hazards may be present when employees are performing golf course landscaping and maintenance. Each a ctivity needs to be analyzed and safeguards implemented. Some of the more common \\nhazards are discussed below.  \\nWeather -Related  Hazards:  \\nWeather -related hazards that can harm employees: Hot temperatures may cause heat exhaustion or heat stroke. \\nLandscaping activities may require employees to work under the sun a great part of the day. Skin cancer hazards \\nfrom exposure to the sun are well documented. To reduce this exposure, employees should be provided and \\nencouraged to apply sun block with a high Sun Protection Factor (SPF). Brimmed hats, long- sleeved shirts and long \\npants are also recommended. When it is hot and/or humid outside, employees should be encouraged to drink plenty of fluids to prevent dehydration, heat exhaustion, and heat stroke. Fr equent breaks may be needed \\nespecially when strenuous physical work is being  performed.  \\n  ', metadata={'source': 'Bussiness_facility/Golf-and-Grounds-Maintenance-Safety-Manual.pdf', 'page': 2}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=' \\nMowing and Other Landscaping  Equipment:  \\nMowers, tractors, weed eaters, and other tools and equipment are used to mow greens, fairways, and maintain \\nother parts of th e course. Operators are exposed to hazards from contact with mower blades and other \\nmechanical components. Injuries from flying debris may also occur. Hearing loss from long -term exposure to high \\nnoise levels may result. In addition, rollover accidents fro m operating tractors or other riding equipment may \\nhappen when traversing steep grades. The safety precautions in the manufacturer’s handbook should be followed when operating any mowing or landscaping equipment. The appropriate PPE should be used when ope rating \\nlandscaping and maintenance equipment. Eye protection, hearing protection, gloves and other PPE may be needed. Hardhats and reflective vests should be worn when working on the course where the potential for being struck by errant golf balls  exists.  \\nThe fueling of mowing and landscaping equipment can present a fire hazard. Equipment should be shut off before \\nfueling and this should be done outside or where adequate ventilation exists. Smoking should be strictly prohibited \\nand other potential ignition sources removed from the fueling area. Portable gas cans should be UL listed or FM approved. Emergency fuel shutoff switches should be installed and fire extinguishers located nearby.  \\nSome riding mowers, tractors, and other equipment may be equipped with s eat belts. Where provided, they \\nshould be worn.  \\nMost machines and equipment have guards installed to protect employees from rotating blades, belts, and other \\nhazards. Guards should be inspected prior to use and equipment should never be operated unless gua rds are in \\nplace.  \\nThe inspection and maintenance procedures and schedules described in manufacturer manuals should be \\nfollowed and documented. Any modifications to the equipment should be approved by the manufacturer.  \\nTree Hazard  Management:  \\nThe trees on the Golf Course need to be managed so they do not create an undue hazard for golfers. Corrective action should be taken as necessary to eliminate or reduce hazards. Employees who perform tree trimming need to wear personal protective equipment such as eye a nd face protection, gloves, safety shoes, and hearing \\nprotection should be provided. Downed trees and branches should be removed from the course promptly to \\nprevent golfers from driving or falling over them.  \\nLIABILITY AND RISK MANAGEMENT:  \\nThis involves ide ntifying potential risks to not only to the City of Coral Gables assets, but also to ensure a safe \\nenvironment for employees, residents, visitors and participants. Parks and Recreation staff are to notify the Risk \\nManager and the Public Works department of  any risk pertaining to the Facilities that is not noticed by the Public \\nWorks Department and the Risk Manager during their periodic checks of the facilities. If a risk on the premises is \\nidentified and the area can’t be closed off, warnings should be plac ed in such areas until such time the area is \\nrepaired. Safety training is provided by the Risk Manager to all Parks and Recreation Supervisory staff regarding \\nthe identification, minimization and avoidance of safety  risks.  \\nIn the event of an accident, the Risk Manager and Public Works must be notified. Should the accident be attributable to a condition of the premises that can’t be remedied by Parks and Recreation staff, that area where the condition is located needs to be blocked off, if that  is not possible warnings need to be placed  \\n ', metadata={'source': 'Bussiness_facility/Golf-and-Grounds-Maintenance-Safety-Manual.pdf', 'page': 3}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\" \\nGolf Cart Safety \\nGolf Cart Accident Statistics  \\nIt's easy to view golf carts more as novelties than true motor vehicles. But the fact is they pose similar risks as \\nyour car or motorcycle, especially when taken off the golf course.  \\nHere are some golf cart accident statistics to keep in mind as you approach these 4 -wheeled favorites:  \\n• Turning at just 11 mph is fast enough to easily throw passengers out of a  cart \\n• Over 10,000 emergency room visits each year result from  golf cart accidents, according to the Consumer Product \\nSafety Commission  (CPSC)  \\n• About 40 percent of golf cart accidents involve someone falling out of the vehicle; and roughly  10 percent \\ninvolve a rollover, per CPSC data.  \\nSome safety tips to consider:  \\n• Never drive recklessly or joy ride. Drive courteously. Obey all vehicle traffic laws and rules of the  road.  \\n• Never drive intoxicated or under the influence of any drug or  narcotic.  \\n• Avoid distractions while operating the golf cart just as you would  in an automobile. Be safe and  attentive  -- avoid \\ntalking, texting, or reading while driving, reaching for objects, applying makeup or eating.  \\n• Only carry the number of passengers for which there are  seats.  \\n• Drivers and all passengers should keep all body parts (arms, legs, feet) inside cart while vehicle is in motion, except when signaling a  turn.  \\n• Do not allow anyone to ride standing in the vehicle or on the back platform of the vehicle. Do not put vehicle in motion until all passengers are safely seated inside  vehicle.  \\n• Operate the vehicle from the driver’s side  only.  \\n• Always use hand signals to indicate your intent to turn due to the small size and limited visibility of the turn signals on a golf cart.  \\n• Check blind spots before turning. When making a le ft hand turn, yield to the thru traffic lane and merge into that \\nlane before turning left. Never make a left hand turn from the golf cart  lane.  \\n• Carefully turn and look behind golf cart before backing  up. \\n \", metadata={'source': 'Bussiness_facility/Golf-and-Grounds-Maintenance-Safety-Manual.pdf', 'page': 4})]"
